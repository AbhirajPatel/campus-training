<b>TATA STEEL LTD.,Jamshedpur (May-June 2016</b><br>
<b>Study the Grain growth kinetics of Isotropic Polycryastalline Material By Phase Feild Modeling</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Developed a C-code to investigate the grain growth in 2-D by computer simulation, based on continuum Diffused Interface Field Model</li>
<li>Developed a model to count the number of Grain, based on Hoshen-Kopelman Algorithm using C-language.
</li>
<li>Modified the preexisting models (C-code) for simulation of Grain growth, which reduces the computational (CPU) time by 1/3rd</li>
<li>Developed an efficient algorithm for computer simulation of the grain growth kinetics, which reduces the CPU time by 1/6 th of classical model.</li>
